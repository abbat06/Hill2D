# Libration family *a*

It is a family of zeromultiple $\Sigma_1$-symmetric libration orbits which are contracted at $С_{lib} = 3^{4/3} \approx 4.32675$ to the libration point $L_1$. This family is generated by arc $\{+1\}$ has no stable orbits and under $\Sigma_2$ mapping it goes over into family $с$ which is generated by arc $\{–1\}$ and consists of orbits around the libration point $L_2$. Families described in [Henon1969].
