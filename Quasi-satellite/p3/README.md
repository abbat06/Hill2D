# Family *He*

Family $He$ of $\Sigma_1$-symmetric orbits with two 
loops generated by arc $\{+3\}$. This family, being continued over parameter $C$, reaches its maximum at $С \approx –8.615196$, and at further continuation over $С$ the family’s orbits tend in the limit 
to generating sequence $\{+1, е, i\}$. It has two intervals of 
stability, intersects with family Hi of asymmetric orbits 
(see [12]), specified in the limit by generating sequences {+2,i} and {+2, е}, and also it intersects with two families of $\Sigma_1$-symmetric orbits with local multiplicity 2, which in the limit are specified by sequences $\{i, +2, +2, е\}$ and $\{i, +1, е, +3\}$, respectively.
