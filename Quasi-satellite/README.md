# Families of quasi-satellite orbits

Here we describe families of $\Sigma_1$-symmetric periodic solutions generated by a single arc $\{+j\}$, $j=1,2,\dots,7$.

Generating solutions given by the arc $\{+1\}$ produce libration family *a* [Henon69]([see](./Hill2D/Libration/a/README.md).

Generating solutions given by the arcs $\{+2\}$ produce family *g'*  of single revolution satellite orbits [Henon69]([see](./Hill2D/Satellite/g'/README.md).

Generating solutions given by the arc $\{+3\}$ specifies family *He* of orbits with two revolutions [Henon2003]([see](./Hill2D/Quasi-satellite/p3/README.md).
