# Short description of families with transfer orbits to or between libration points

## Families specified by sequences $\{(+1)^n, (+2)^m\}, n, m \in \mathbb N$ 
At continuation over $С$ they give orbits consisting of $n$ revolutions around the libration point $L_1$ and of $m$ lowperigee orbits with apogee in the vicinity of $L_1$. Such families are generalizations of families *Нb*, *Hd*, and *Hf*, and they can be used when planning transfers to neighborhoods of collinear libration points $L_1$ and $L_2$ nearest to the Earth.

## Families specified by sequences $\{(–1)^n, (+l)^m\}, n,m \in\mathbb N$ 
They give orbits executing $n$ revolutions around $L_2$, then a transfer, and $m$ revolutions around $L_1$. These families are a generalization of family $f_3$, and they can be used when planning transfers between libration points $L_1$ and $L_2$.

## Families specified by sequences $\{(–1)^n, (+2)^m\}, n > m$ 
They give orbits executing $n$ revolutions around $L_1$ and 
$m$ lowperigee orbits with apogee in the vicinity of $L_2$.
