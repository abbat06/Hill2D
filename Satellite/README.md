# Satellite orbits

M. Hénon described in [Henon69] and [Henon70] four basic families of symmetric periodic solutions of the Hill’s problem whose orbits execute one revolution around the coordinate origin: $f$, $g$, $g'$, and $f_3$ (in [Henon70] the last family is called $g_3$).

Families $g$ and $f$ are families of double symmetric direct and retrograde satellite orbits.
