# Satellite orbits

M. Hénon described in [Henon69] and [Henon70] four basic families of symmetric periodic solutions of the Hill’s problem whose orbits execute one revolution around the coordinate origin: $f$, $g$, $g'$, and $f_3$ (in [Henon70] the last family is called $g_3$).

Families $g$ and $f$ are families of double symmetric direct and retrograde satellite orbits [Henon69]. 

Family $g'$ is a family of of single revolution satellite orbits. Being continued over parameter this family reaches the maximum at $С\approx 4.49998584$ and is intersected with family g of doubly symmetric orbits. At $С \approx 3.68448$ there is an orbit of collision, and on the interval $(3.68448, 4.49999)$ family $g'$ consists of direct orbits, while at $С < 3.68448$ – of retrograde orbits. Family $g'$ has two intervals of stability: the first at $С\in (–4.704765; –4.692170)$ and the second at $С \in (4.271428; 
4.499986)$, i.e., on one interval all stable orbits of the family are retrograde, and on another interval they are direct. Stability index $S$ on every interval runs through the entire range of values $[–1; +1]$. Hence, the family $g'$ intersects with other families of periodic solutions whose local multiplicity is $q\geq 1$, $q \in \mathbb N$. On the first interval of stability the family $g'$ intersects at $С \approx –4.704765$ with family *Hh* [Henon2005] of 
asymmetric periodic solutions which is specified by generating sequences $\{+1, i\}$ and $\{+1, е\}$. At $С \approx –4.692170$ the family $g'$ intersects with of twoorbit solutions specified in the limit by sequence ${i, +1, +1, е}$ [HillBook]. On the second interval of stability at $С ≈ 4.271428 fam 
ily g' intersects with family Ha (see [5]) of twoorbit solu 
tions, which is specified by sequence {+2, i, e} (see 
Table 1), and also, as was already mentioned above, with 
family g specifies by sequence {i, е}.
