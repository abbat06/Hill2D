# Satellite orbits

M. Hénon described in [Henon69] and [Henon70] four basic families of symmetric periodic solutions of the Hill’s problem whose orbits execute one revolution around the coordinate origin: *f*, *g*, *g'*, and *f_3* (in [Henon70] and [Henon2003] the last family is called *g_3*).

Families *g* and *f* are families of double symmetric direct and retrograde satellite orbits [Henon69], [Hillbook]. 

Family *g'* is a family of of single revolution satellite orbits ([see](./Hill2D/Satellite/g'/README.md)).
