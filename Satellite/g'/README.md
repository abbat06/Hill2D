## Family *g'* is a family of single revolution satellite orbits [Henon69], [Hillbook]

This family reaches the maximum at $С\approx 4.49998584$ and is intersected with family *g* of doubly symmetric orbits. At $С \approx 3.68448$ there is an orbit of collision, and on the interval $(3.68448, 4.49999)$ family *g'* consists of direct orbits, while at $С < 3.68448$ – of retrograde orbits. Family $g'$ has two intervals of stability: the first at $С\in (–4.704765; –4.692170)$ and the second at $С \in (4.271428; 
4.499986)$, i.e., on one interval all stable orbits of the family are retrograde, and on another interval they are direct. 

Stability index $S$ on every interval runs through the entire range of values $[–1; +1]$. Hence, the family *g'* intersects with other families of periodic solutions whose local multiplicity is $q\geq 1$, $q \in \mathbb N$. On the first interval of stability the family *g'* intersects at $С \approx –4.704765$ with family *Hh* [Henon2005] of asymmetric periodic solutions which is specified by generating sequences $\{+1, i\}$ and $\{+1, е\}$. At $С \approx –4.692170$ the family *g'* intersects with of twoorbit solutions specified in the limit by sequence ${i, +1, +1, е}$ [HillBook]. On the second interval of stability at $С \approx 4.271428$ family *g'* intersects with family *Ha* (see [5]) of two orbit solutions, which is specified by sequence {+2, i, e}, and also with family *g* specifies by sequence {i, е}.
